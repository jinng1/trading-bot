# Crypto Trading Bot (WIP)

This is a Crypto Trading Bot with four key features:
1. **Data Pipeline**
2. **Model Training**
3. **Backtesting**
4. **Live Trading**

Each feature is designed to perform a specific task within the bot's operation. This README provides an overview of the essential functions under each feature.

---

## 1. Data Pipeline

The Data Pipeline is responsible for gathering, processing, and managing the data required for model training and trading.

### Functions:

- **`fetch_data(symbol, interval, start_time, filename)`**: Retrieves historical market data from an API (e.g., Binance). Allows you to specify the symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT), time interval (e.g., 1 minute, 1 hour), and date to today.
  
- **`preprocess_data(raw_data)`**: Cleans and formats the raw data (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing or scaling the data).

- **`store_data(data, filename)`**: Saves preprocessed data into a CSV file or database for further analysis or model training.

- **`update_data(symbol, interval)`**: Periodically checks for new data and updates the dataset.

- **`feature_engineering(data)`**: Generates technical features such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands for the model.

## 2. Model Training

Model Training is the core of the bot’s decision-making process. It involves using historical data to train a machine learning model that predicts market conditions and trades.

### Functions:

- **`prepare_data_for_model(data)`**: Prepares the data for training by splitting it into features (X) and targets (y).

- **`train_model(training_data)`**: Trains the model using the prepared data. This can include methods like Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Neural Networks, or other machine learning models.

- **`evaluate_model(model, validation_data)`**: Evaluates the model using validation data and calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or custom performance metrics.

- **`save_model(model, filename)`**: Saves the trained model to a file for future use (e.g., for backtesting or live trading).

- **`load_model(filename)`**: Loads a previously trained model from a file to be used in backtesting or live trading.

## 3. Backtesting

Backtesting is used to test how the trading strategy would have performed on historical data. It simulates trades and evaluates their outcomes.

### Functions:

- **`simulate_trading_strategy(model, historical_data)`**: Simulates trading using the trained model on historical data and returns performance metrics like profit, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.

- **`evaluate_strategy_performance(trading_results)`**: Analyzes the backtest results to evaluate the performance of the strategy (e.g., win rate, risk-adjusted returns).

- **`optimize_parameters(hyperparameters, data)`**: Tunes the model’s hyperparameters to improve performance using historical data.

- **`plot_backtest_results(trading_results)`**: Visualizes the backtest results, such as portfolio value over time and trade performance.

- **`save_backtest_results(results, filename)`**: Saves the results of the backtest for later analysis or reporting.

## 4. Live Trading

Live Trading connects the bot to real-world exchanges and executes trades based on predictions made by the trained model.

### Functions:

- **`connect_to_exchange(api_key, secret_key)`**: Connects to the exchange (e.g., Binance, Kraken) using API keys for authentication.

- **`get_live_data(symbol, interval)`**: Fetches real-time market data from the exchange to feed into the model.

- **`execute_trade(action, quantity, symbol)`**: Executes a buy or sell trade based on the model’s decision (e.g., buy BTC, sell ETH).

- **`monitor_open_positions()`**: Monitors the open positions in the portfolio to ensure trades are executed as expected.

- **`risk_management()`**: Applies risk management rules, such as stop-loss or take-profit thresholds, to minimize exposure and prevent excessive losses.

- **`update_live_model()`**: Updates the model with new data and predictions in real-time, making the model adaptive to the latest market conditions.

- **`log_trades(trade_details)`**: Keeps a log of executed trades for future analysis and performance reviews.

- **`terminate_trading()`**: Safely terminates live trading, either due to user input or a critical issue.

## Workflow of the Trading Bot

1. **Data Pipeline**: Collects and processes new market data for training and trading.
2. **Model Training**: Trains a model using historical data, stores the model for future use.
3. **Backtesting**: Tests the model on historical data to evaluate its performance and fine-tune parameters.
4. **Live Trading**: Once backtesting is complete, the model trades in real-time, making decisions based on current market conditions.

## Additional Considerations:

- **Logging**: Each module should implement detailed logging to help with debugging, tracking performance, and auditing trades.
  
- **Error Handling**: The bot should handle API errors, network issues, and unexpected market behaviors gracefully.
  
- **Scheduling**: Consider using task schedulers like **Celery** or **APScheduler** to automate tasks such as model retraining or data updates.

This bot is designed for modularity and flexibility. Each feature is independent, so you can update, improve, and debug each part separately.
